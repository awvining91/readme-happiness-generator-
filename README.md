# Readme-Happiness-Generator!!!

## Auto-generate your readme file!

This app used node.js, fs and inquirer to create a readme file for you so you can focus on other things!

## Challenges

The hardest challenge was trying to transition from front end to back end programming. I was comfortable with front end stuff and node.js threw me for a loop initially while I was trying to wrap my head around it. I had trouble initially with the logic, trying to get everything to work. Eventually once I looked at the mini project and past exercises I got back on track.

## Next Steps 

It looks like we will be using node.js for the remainder of the back-end portion of the bootcamp so I will keep honing my skills. This week we started on OOP Object Oriented Programming which is pretty crazy. I will try to get started on the challenge asap so that I can ask questions if I get stuck on something.
